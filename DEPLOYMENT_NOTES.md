# Deployment Implementation Notes

## Transition from Pulumi to gcloud CLI

This project originally used Pulumi for infrastructure as code, but has been fully transitioned to using the Google Cloud CLI (gcloud) for all deployment operations. This document explains the transition and provides important notes about the current implementation.

### Important Implementation Details

1. **Removed Pulumi Infrastructure**
   - The `pulumi` directory has been moved to `deprecated/pulumi_backup` for reference
   - All Pulumi configuration files and deployment scripts are no longer used
   - The application now exclusively uses gcloud CLI commands for deployment

2. **Package.json Pulumi Dependencies**
   - The following Pulumi packages remain in package.json but are not used:
     - `@pulumi/docker`
     - `@pulumi/gcp`
     - `@pulumi/pulumi`
   - These packages were left in package.json to avoid potential build issues
   - None of the Pulumi code is imported or executed in the application

3. **Deployment Scripts**
   - `cloud-deploy.sh`: Primary deployment script using gcloud CLI
   - `cloud-cleanup.sh`: Resource cleanup script for Google Cloud resources
   - Both scripts are self-contained and don't rely on Pulumi at all

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - README.md has been updated to remove all references to Pulumi
   - CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT.md provides detailed instructions using only gcloud CLI
   - All environment variable references have been updated for gcloud compatibility

### Future Recommendations

1. **Package Cleanup (Optional)**
   - When appropriate, consider using the package manager to uninstall the unused Pulumi dependencies
   - This should be done with caution to avoid breaking the build process

2. **Full Documentation Review**
   - Although we've updated the primary documentation, a thorough review of all documentation would ensure no remaining Pulumi references

### Google Cloud Resource Management

The application now uses these scripts for cloud resource management:

- `cloud-deploy.sh`: Creates all required resources (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Artifact Registry)
- `cloud-cleanup.sh`: Safely removes all created resources

Both scripts provide interactive prompts and detailed logging for each step in the process.
